---

## Version 1.6e1 (June 7, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **Updated to support 1.22.5**
- **Fixes:**
  - Fix for damage not properly scaling when adding mods to weapons, this fix may actually fix some other errors as it was a syntax bug. Thanks for the bug report
  - Rebalancing of the loot tables to have a few more items on the biters and virals beyond just camo. The goal of the mod is to make the biters and virals have less farm related items so that they are found in the environment, to help balance for the vast number of infected added by the mod compared to vanilla.
  - Removed glowsticks and flares from showing up at shops for now until I tie in some more code to make these seem useful
  - Rebalanced traders to have more accessories from the mod
  - Fix for the stash module causing errors

---

## Version 1.6e (May 12, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **Updated to support 1.22.4**

  - New camo blends found at shops
- **Balancing for Casual Survivor:**
  - Reduced the amount of initial Volatiles seen in the world and with chases ...UNTIL level 2 & 3. The goal of the mod is to allow you to use the new tools and environment to escape, this should allow you plenty of gape to get away or use camouflage.
- **Added back the Fuel Bombs and Fire Bombs:**
  - Easier to find at shops and cost less to make
- **Fixes for large number of Nocturnal weapon drops:**
  - Rebalanced the loot to sometimes include these weapons in darkzones but not on biters and at encounters
- **Fix for Grip bug:**
  - The grip and reinforcement mods should show back up now, thanks for reporting
- **Balancing for loot:**
  - Rebalanced a large volume of glowstick and signal flares showing up in the world and at traders
  - Rebalanced the infected to be more likely to drop camouflage and to contain less jewelry and cash...never cared for that
  - Rebalanced Small trophies to be more likely to show up

  - Added back Inventory settings, you can now adjust the amount of slots for Weapons, Equipment, Consumables, and Ammo.

### Changelog:

- **New Infected:**
  - Release of the Enraged/ Viral/ and Armored variants of the Charger, Goon, and Demolisher. Enraged will attempt to run you down but can't climb, Viral can climb and jump between buildings. Armored will take planning to bring down, as they are the undead Dreadnaughts of the mod. Think "Juggernaut" You'll see a hud health bar when they are near.
  - Alpha Volatiles also have a chance to spawn. You'll see a hud health bar when they are near.
  - Chemical and Venom variants also now have Hud displays so you know they are around
- **Restored Running in Bases:**
  - May not work on all of them, but you should be able to run around the Bazaar and others with the mod
- **Alcohol is now stored in Inventory again:**
  - Based on feedback, alcohol is no longer instant consume

---

## Version 1.6c (March 15, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **Base building content added back to traders:**
  - You can now find some of the base building items around the world at traders
  - Deployable UV light kits and PK reinforcements can be found at PK traders

  - The Mod config will now properly toggle the visuals for Survivor sense, this was broken due to an official update but wasn't reported
  - Some of the distance settings were changed with the update as well so please let me know if you run into any issues with the current mod config settings.

**Note:** Due to the amount of my free time being spent on developing the Unofficial Dev Tools/Infinity Designer/Community Launcher, I rely on the community to create bug reports for issues with the mod. So please submit bug reports to report actual confirmed issues inside the mod and I will fix them with the updates as I go.

---

  - All food should now properly heal only without Hunger & Thirst Module

---

## Version 1.6b (March 11, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **Instant consume food items:**
  - All food found around the world when playing the normal IALR difficulties (without Hunger & Thirst module) will now drop out of your inventory, bloat be gone, and will be instantly consumed for a small percentage of health.
  - All food items will continued to be stored in your inventory if you use the Hunger & Thirst module, so you can plan ahead.
- **Nerfed Volatile difficulty and spawn rates for Survivor:**
  - Continued to reduce the large volume of Volatiles that were spawning during chases in Survivor I hope this helps a lot of you.
  - Let me know if going up to Ultimate to restore this feels too unbalanced, happy to continue to balance as we go with feedback.
  - You can still adjust amounts in the Mod Config for all difficulties in the Chase section, I just reduced some of the backend systems meant to add more difficulty and spawns.
- **Fix for health regen on Hunger & Thirst module** based on bug report

---

## Version 1.6a1 (March 11, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **Updated to 1.21.4**
- Potential fix for Large ammo boxes being un-lootable based on bug report

---

## Version 1.6a (March 8, 2025)

### Changelog:

  - Huge shoutout to @Reclord for finishing the translations for IALR in Turkish! Thank you for doing that for the mod and for the community
  - Several other members of the community have reached out and are working on translations for the excel as well, their current progress has been released with the update.
- **Fix for Crafting menu options:**
  - This feature has been temp removed from the mod to better support the official changes after a report that the mod is removing features.

---

## Version 1.6 (March 5, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **1.6 Released:**
  - Stay tuned for lots more updates coming, time for a fresh start
- **New DoomsDay Prepper and Apex Predator Skins:**
  - The DoomsDay Prepper and Apex Predator have finally gotten their new skin, start a new game to check out their new items and skins.
  - You can equip these skins any time from the Stash Extras section, but won't get the items that come with starting with a new pathway.
  - All items given can be found ingame with IALR.
- **TowerRaids virals and biters added to the world spawns:**
  - I'm still looking into a couple of new modules for Tower Raids, but I wanted to go ahead and get started by adding these biters and virals to the world.
- **IALR now supports 14 languages in Dying Light 2**

---

## Version 1.6pre24 (March 4, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **Added support for 6 new languages for the mod:**
  - Arabic, Chinese, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, and Russian have been added to the mod languages section for DL2
  - Are they the best translations in the world? Absolutely not a large majority are still done by Google Translate, but it's a start in the right direction now that the characters have been solved for.

---

## Version 1.6pre23 (March 3, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **Overhaul to all languages:**
  - I've finally had a moment to write the new tools for converting your helpful entries from the Language translation excel into the game. I've also made this read only for now, as some users damaged the format of the excel and left a lot of weird changes, so if you would like to help in the translation efforts please just let me know and I'll add you as an editor. More editors are definitely needed, as a large majority of the translations are still coming from google translate.
  - All languages now have special characters! Finally. Sadly I'm struggling to get Russian, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese working but hopefully soon!
- **Fix for The Raid Quest:**
  - After the official update 1.21.0, some of the AI behavior has been weird with AI walking towards the player, this happened with a boss. Thanks to a bug report with a savegame this was a super easy fix.
- **Fix for The Stash Module:**
  - Somewhat, after an official update, Techland removed the code needed to make this one simple, but I've got a temp work around, more of the packs are working now. This is not 100% fixed, but getting there.

---

## Version 1.6pre22 (February 27, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **Updated to 1.21.3**

**Note:** It sounded like some players may still be experiencing a issue with the renegade enemies running at the player and not attacking after the 1.21.1 update, but it's been difficult to get confirmation that the users are running 1.6pre20+. If you're still having this issue, please write a bug report with details about which groups of enemies and which attacks if possible

---

## Version 1.6pre21 (February 21, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **Updated to 1.21.2:**
  - This update did make inventory changes so make sure to grab the latest version to prevent savegame corruption
- **Fixes to child biters:**
  - A report was made a bit ago about a child biter missing some arms that's been fixed along with a few other missing hands...poor kids got nommed on pretty bad with an update.

---

## Version 1.6pre20 (February 20, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **Support for TowerRaids:**
  - The biters and enemies should properly work now but I mean...you may want to play Tower Raids on Casual Survivor, it's probably going to be pretty hard with the mod. The idea of the mod is to use climbing, speed, parkour, and camo to your advantage as a runner, and I'm not sure TowerRaids close encounters will work well with the mod for now, but I have some ideas coming up.
- **Fix for more AI issues:**
  - After the official 1.21.1 update, there have been several issues reported with the distance calculation for the AI for humans, demolishers, goons, and volatiles (during the day). This update should fix all of those issues except maybe the volatiles.
- **Fix for Stash items:**
  - I've gone through and fixed several of the starter bundles, Trophy Conversion bundle, and other IALR start bundles to work as a 1 time use in your stash. More updates will be coming in the future and this does not currently included fixes for the Stash Module, that still needs to be overhauled.

**Note:** I'm sure there will be more, this update broke hundreds of scripts.

---

## Version 1.6pre19b (February 19, 2025) - Hotfix

### Changelog:
- **Human AI bug:**
  - As mentioned previously, this latest update refactored alot of XML code, which this mod deeply modifies the base AI for a lot of the NPCs in the game and custom added.
  - This hotfix fixes the issues reported

**Note:** I'm sure there will be more, this update broke hundreds of scripts. Thanks Techland you guys really know how to kill a day, all this could always be avoided by giving early access to the modders. Auto-heal can't get here fast enough.

---

## Version 1.6pre19 (February 19, 2025)

### Changelog:
**Gameplay:**
- **Mod updated to 1.6pre17 to support 1.21.1**
- Reduced the Volatile spawns on Survivor difficulty
- Various fixes to each Module
- Removed Custom Map Changes Module, as it's very outdated at this point and will need to be remade with better support
- Removed Volatile Chemical and Venom variants from Survivor

**Note:** Update 1.21.1 introduced a large change to all AI and how the XML calculates AI movement. I believe all issues have been fixed for all the custom AI but without extensive testing it won't be clear, so please report bugs with AI as bug reports and add, video, images, and details of what was acting strange

---

## Version 1.6pre18 (February 10, 2025)

### Changelog:
- **Potential fix for daytime crashes after official update:**
  - Took a lot of trial and error, but I'm able to run through the city without crashes currently. Please test on your side
- **New launcher update**
- **Updated all IAL_Settings.mth's:**
  - Across all difficulties to use the new generated file from the launcher
  - After testing with the new 2.1c launcher, I can't get any of the previously reported crashes to happen

---

## Version 1.6pre17 (February 7, 2025)

### Changelog:
**Gameplay:**
- **Mod updated to 1.6pre17 to support 1.21.0**
- Fix for VolatilesBeGone to now properly remove all roaming Volatiles, atleast from the testing I did, let me know if I missed an area. For clarification, please make sure you're playing the mod on Casual or Survivor for this to work with all other features, it's not meant for Ultimate or Insanity.
- Fix for PK troops not using UV flares
- Fix for human AI not properly spotting and attacking enemies, Humans are much more aggressive towards biters. This still isn't perfect, but I think it's a huge improvement.
- Removed random UV lights showing up all over some parts of the city, this is too easy to farm currently, working on a new approach

**Models:**
- Fix for reported models that had missing faces
- Added 20 new child infected biters
- Reworked the PK visuals to use more of the original colors (less bright blue) and added 36 new looks for patrolling PK
- Fixes for some visual glitches with biters, clipping through other materials, etc

**Note:** You still need to run the actual installer again after the download is finished. The code will claim that you're updated but it's not currently running the installer immediately for you, so you need to run it for this to truly apply.

---

## Version 1.6pre16 (December 17, 2024)

### Changelog:
- **Mod updated to 1.6pre16 to support 1.20.1**
- Make sure to run the installer again to make sure the update applies when it downloads on the launcher, you can either use the Update button or relaunch to get the update

**Note:** I'm heads down working on 1.6 this week, it's about to be wild ^.^ I'm super excited to share this new update

---

## Version 1.6pre15 (December 11, 2024)

### Changelog:
- **Launcher updated to 2.0e**
- **Mod updated to 1.6pre15**
- Fix for the update process, new autoinstaller feature implemented but may run into issues so for now, after an update is released, always run the installer again to make sure it installed the update!
- Fix for a large number of small bugs and glitched visuals on the new infected

**Note:** I noticed that the restore feature on multiplayer is not currently working for restoring back to the point before you went into Multiplayer, that will be getting fixed soon but it should still have your actual selections from the installer so you can easily just press install again after getting offline with your buddy.

---

## Version 1.6pre14 (December 3, 2024)

### Changelog:
- **Updated to 1.19.3**
- Added 75 new biters, slowly bringing back the custom infected
- Fix for investation crash
- Fix for Vanilla + IALR Content blob

---

## Version 1.6pre13 (November 14, 2024)

### Changelog:
- **Updated to 1.19.2**

**Note:** I was working on a gamejam the last 7 days but finally finished up, I'm working again on having the new launcher and 1.6 out by the end of the month, the launcher much sooner.

---

## Version 1.6pre12 (November 7, 2024)

### Changelog:
- **Updated to 1.19.1**
- Fix for biters climbing after 1.19.0 on Ultimate and Insanity and through the Mod config
- Fix for virals attacking the player
- Fix for language modules not working properly, there is a large overhaul coming on the language modules with more support for more languages that will be released with 1.6

---

## Version 1.6pre11 (October 30, 2024)

### Changelog:
- **Update to 1.19.0:**
  - I was able to generate around 75% of this update but the auto-heal code still has a way to go, lots of small things can end up taking more time to fix in the long run so more work to do.
- **Improved Chaos system:**
  - The new improvements to the chaos system help improve the overall world spawn systems and help remove the enemies spawning in directly in front of you. Events should now take place further away from the player and there may be a horde waiting for you around a corner or inside an interior. A drastic overhaul to this system is coming with 1.6 but I have more testing and building to do!
- **Fixes for spawn bugs:**
  - I've put in some more time on the spawn bugs people have been reporting and hope it helps improve the gameplay for the different difficulties. There was a spawn issue with large amounts of volatiles and enemies constantly spawning in interiors after an update. This should be working better and the new Chaos system improvements may help as well.
- **Fixes for shops and inventory:**
  - Along with now using the new Unofficial Dev Tools to fix issues, I've found a small amount of various bugs that I've been working to fix in the inventory and trader systems.

**Known bugs:**
- There are still some balancing and small bugs in the system such as the Viral spitter not spitting...that ones interesting, just can't find why that's the case, but I'll get it with 1.6.
- I encountered a few humanAI bugs when play testing, random bandits not attacking and whatnot.

---

## Version 1.6pre10 (August 21, 2024)

### Changelog:
- **Updated to support 1.18.0**

---

## Version 1.6pre8 (June 28, 2024)

### Changelog:
- **Updated to support 1.17.0.1**
- **Added support for Nightmare difficulty** to Survivor Options: Thirst and Hunger
- **Added New Module: Stash Unlock:**
  - This module provides you with all of the content in IALR immediately in your stash. I wouldn't recommend using this if you're a newcomer to the mod!
- **Added New Pathway: Apex Predator:**
  - This Pathway allows you to skip ahead of the pack and immediately get some of the cooler items from IALR and dive right into the combat. This option adds all skills and higher level options from the start. Recommended to skip the prologue if you use this option so you don't get softlocked by the tutorial bug. Also not recommended for newcomers to the mod

---

## Version 1.6pre6 (April 25, 2024)

### Changelog:
- **Updated to 1.16.1**
- Fix for outdated crafting items not having names (by removing them for now)
- Removed continuous enemy spawns in Casual Survivor and Survivor difficulty. Survivor seems to have enough challenges with the increased spawns to not require the additional continuous spawns in the vanilla game.

**Note:** Survival Options - Hunger and Thirst module does not currently support Nightmare difficulty due to the new "advanced/tactical stamina" update in the logic after the 1.16.0 update. I need to review and dial in the mod to support that difficulty so that will be coming with the 1.6 update, for now just switch to Hard difficulty if you have that module installed. Lots to do, very little time.

---

## Version 1.6pre5 (April 18, 2024)
**Released on launcher**

### Changelog:
- **Updated to 1.16**
- **Updated to support Nightmare difficulty**
- All modules, events, pathways, and languages have been updated to support the 1.16 update.
- Fix for Pathway selections PK, Veteran, and Roadwarrior to support a new skin when starting a new game, and the armor that had clipping issues was removed from the starting character.

**Known bugs:**
- Armor clipping is still an issue with all custom armors (still no fix in sight)
- Custom Maps Optional still has the Sofia bug when trying to continue the quest, I'll return to using the Techland Mod tools eventually but for now there's too much to do in other areas.
- I noticed that some savegames seem to have the wrong flashlight settings baked into the savegame, so if your flashlight is super weak it may be due to that.

---

## Version 1.6pre4 (April 10, 2024)

### Changelog:
- **Added new Veteran skin to Stash** for all players and to the Veteran Pathway
- Fix for IALR_Content difficulty having a stamina bug

---

## Version 1.6pre3 (March 21, 2024)
**Released on launcher and Nexus**

### Changelog:
- **Updated the mod to support 1.15.4**
- Fix for spawns on Insanity to fix roaming Volatiles, camouflage is now 100% required for movement at night, everything can smell and track you across the map.
- Fix for some biters always running even with Mod Config settings set to Walker

---

## Version 1.6pre2 (March 15, 2024)
**Released on launcher and Nexus**

### Changelog:
- Fix for warzone like spawns occurring throughout the city, the city spawns have been better balanced and the error was removed.
- Fix for Volatile health being super tanky, this was due to a repeat value that was removed from the preset (this can happen when merging after updates).
- Fix for Biter_Fresh running or walking being set by the config, you should now be able to easily set all Biters to run and climb or walk and not climb through the Mod config
- Fix for crash from VolatilesBeGone module
- Added description when loading IALR Content that warns players that a large amount of the features from IALR are disabled in that difficulty setting. That difficulty is primarily for users who want to be able to play the Vanilla game without the Savegame corruption risk, around 70% of the features from the mod are disabled in this version. If you're looking for a less difficult experience I would use Casual Survivor.
- Fix for Invisible Virals. All IALR Models have now been removed for the Infected, they are being redesigned for the 1.6 release.
- Fix for Reinforcements now spawning from the different factions, after the 1.15 update they changed the reinforcement system and this had to be re-written.

---

## Version 1.6pre1 (March 13, 2024) - Hotfix
**Released on launcher and Nexus**

### Changelog:
- Infestation has been rebalanced to focus on more infected and less humans spawning in the world. There will still be patrols and the new factions randomly in the world, but more of the spawns are focused on Biters and infected.
- Fix for black screen crash when starting a new save.
- Fix for crashes with Deadly Humans, Infestation, and Survivor Module
- Updated all modules with 1.6pre changes and improved balancing

---

## Version 1.6pre (March 11, 2024)
**Released on launcher and Nexus**

### Changelog:
- **Updated to 1.15.3**
- Refactor for balancing for all difficulties to improve the spawn systems and fix bugs.
- Firearms can now be traded, dropped, and added to the stash.
- Firearms have received some balancing updates to make the damage more appropriate.
- 5 new Firearms are in development and are currently available through the patreon stash content for the firearms bundles for all Insanity and Ultimate supporters. These new "Hair trigger" weapons are balanced to how I want to play with guns on insanity. They currently do not have names in the UI but are Gold and Platinum tier weapons. More coming soon!
- Insanity difficulty has been completely refactored to make it the most difficult to date, enemies can now smell you, even high up on the buildings. The best way to avoid being slaughtered by the masses is by using the Camouflage as you move. Be prepared for a real parkour challenge to stay alive on this difficulty (yes it's absolutely possible =D)
- Interior Spawns are working again with the custom spawns and they have been updated to now "self activate" so you no longer have to walk into the interior to make the AI search for you. This makes them much more deadly but also may increase performance costs.
- Spawns have been rebalanced to bring the most populated map yet. If you have issues with performance, look inside the Mod Config > World Spawns > Performance tab and turn down the IAL_Spawn_Max_AI_Count (default 120) and IAL_Spawn_Max_AI_Zombie_Spawn_Distance (default 80)
- The Mod config has been updated to remove = Inventory slots, these should not be set unless you are willing to risk savegame corruption with updates, so I have removed them as an option for now. Cheats - Infinite Stamina. FOV Camera setting (AntiFov is set to 0.0 in the mod)

---

## Version 1.5 Series (Major Survival & Module System Updates)

### Key Features Introduced:
- **Release of new IALR Survivor Options: Hunger and Thirst:**
  - No free pass on unlimited energy, you need to ensure you eat and drink food to keep up your strength. Stamina no longer immediately recharges automatically, health no longer regenerates on an empty stomach. All food items now restore your health and stamina's ability to regenerate. 20 new food items have been added to the world.
  
- **New Infestation Module:**
  - The city no longer is safe during the day. The infected no longer suffer from the sunlight and will stop at nothing to kill you. This module is not compatible with Warzones

- **New Deadly Humans Module:**
  - Tired of humans being the least scary thing on the map? Active this module and fear the living

  - A much needed update to the human AI. They should attack enemies with more aggression and they now use the buildings, cars, signs, and other parkour elements to traverse the city, making it easier for them to avoid running into piles of enemies and getting wiped out.

---

## Version 1.4 Series (Camouflage & Advanced Combat Systems)

### Major Features:
- **Insanity Difficulty Release:**
  - A new difficulty has been added to the mod that will bring new levels of challenges utilizing all of the below systems.
