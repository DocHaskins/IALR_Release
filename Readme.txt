Don't want to read all this? It's important but you can also just watch the video that covers most of this, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MidhTMsClpY


***Notice: there is a false flag positive with some of the antivirus software when using my exe's due to the way they are compiled =( I'm sorry this is the case and I'm looking into how to register them with a certificate to fix that issue in the future. Please always feel free to upload the .exe at https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload to check for yourself. I can confirm that 3 out of the 72 antivirus's do spot a generic virus flag but I can assure you this was not done intentionally and the software is not malicious by any means, it's simply required for how I've written the code to properly pull the updates from Github. I hope you understand, thanks.

Using the Launcher
1. Make sure to extract the entire contents of the launcher into a folder. 

	1a. Also make sure it's somewhere it has permissions to write the data, sometimes on your computer extracting applications onto the main C drive or into some place like Documents can causing write permission issues. 

2. The first thing the software will ask for is the Dying Light 2 Root Directory. Make sure you have the right path to Dying Light 2. 

2a. Example C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Dying Light 2

3. Once the launcher opens up with all the buttons you will be properly setup!
3a. Notice the Version ID in the bottom Left corner, if it is Red then the mod has not been properly installed using the new Launcher Installer (Button in the bottom Left toolbar). If this is green then you are good to go!

4. It is important that you run the installer process within the new Launcher for future updates, as this information will be remembered by the software and will be really useful when there are updates.

5. If there is an update available, you can automatically pull and install these updates without needing to do anything yourself other than installing the mod first through the Launcher.


Using the Installer: (Open and close by pressing the Launch Installer button)
1. Open the Launch Installer button and make your selections.

2. You must atleast install a difficulty, let me know if additional information is needed for the description summary.

3. Modules - These are completely optional and you can add as many modules as you would like by selecting them or unselecting them.

4. Events - These are completely optional and you can add as many modules as you would like by selecting them or unselecting them.

5. Pathways - These are completely optional and you can select 1 of them by selecting or unselecting them.

6. Languages - These are completely optional and you can select 1 of them by selecting or unselecting them.

7. Summary - This is where you install the mod, make sure your selection is correct and then hit the Install button. This will then install the mod and all its features into Dying Light 2.

7a. If you get a red failure notice, don't worry this is part of the early launch for the launcher and I'm working out the edge cases, please join the discord community and provide the log.txt that is printed at the same location as the launcher.exe

8. When launching the launcher.exe again you should see a green compatible Game Version and Mod version installed.

Updating the Mod:
1. Once you have successfully installed the mod, when there are future updates for IALR, you will see a  "UPDATE IALR" button. When pressing this button it will automatically pull the latest update and install the features you already selected during the installation process. The button will go away once the update is successful and you're good to go!

Uninstalling the Mod/Toggle the Mod:
1. At any time AFTER installing the mod through the Launch Installer process, you can toggle the mod on or off by clicking the I AM LEGION REBORN Logo on the installer. This will clean all of the IALR content up and remove the mod so you can play Vanilla. The logo should change to Dying Light 2. At any time you should be able to press the logo again to restore IALR.

Installing the Mod manually:
1. This is not recommended but can be done, all of the content needed is inside the IALR_Installer folder, you'll need to go under each folder and select the files you would like and add them to your Dying Light 2/ph/sources folder

Troubleshooting:
- If you get a Install error "Folder is missing" when trying to install the mod, this is commonly due to the update or install not properly installing the folders into your Dying Light 2 folder. When you select that folder at the start, it will copy the contents of the IALR_Installer folder into your Dying Light 2 root. If you want to try to add this manually it may fix a copy error. Just drag or extract the IALR_Installer folder out of the Launcher.zip into your Dying Light 2 root folder.
